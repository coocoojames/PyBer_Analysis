# PyBer Analysis

## Analysis Overview:
&emsp; The purpose of this analysis is to try to understand the pricing strategy, number of drivers, number of riders, and their relationship to a city type.

## Results:
![Summary Data Frame](https://github.com/coocoojames/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Screenshot%202022-01-23%20183147.png)
&emsp; From the results, we can see that the total rides, total drivers, and total fares in rural cities are far less than urban cities and with suburban cities in the middle. 
In fact, urban cities had 13 times more rides than rural cities.<br />
&emsp; The average fare per ride is opposite with the rural having the highest and urban the lowest, but they actually don't vary that much. 
The average fare in rural cities are only $10 more than urban cities. The average fare per driver, however, varies quite a lot with rural cities having almost $40
more than urban cities!<br />

&emsp; From the graph of total fare by city type, we can see that, first of all, there appears to be a serge in fare in all city types during the last quarter of February
and they all start declining until March. We can also see that urban cities have the highest total fare throughout the months, the suburban cities
in the middle and rural cities have the lowest total fare.

## Summary:
&emsp; There is a disparity in fares and different city types but because the average fare per ride and per driver are higher, it almost offsets the disparity in total fare.
However, there are a few things we might want to consider doing:
1. Spend more marketing dollars in rural areas to get more drivers to lower the cost and should in turn, increase the total fare.
2. We might be able to omit spending more marketing dollars if we just lower the cost of rides in rural areas to attract more riders.
3. We can try to understand why there is a serge in fare in February and apply the finding to get more rides in rural areas.
